## Technology & Methodologies

**CSS / BEM Methodology:** Leverages the Block, Element, Modifier convention to maintain a modular class structure. This ensures encapsulated styles and prevents global CSS leakage.

**Object-Oriented JavaScript:** A dedicated JS class manages the logic and heavy functional lifting of the popup.

**Liquid Templating:** Utilizes Liquid markup and conditional rendering to deliver dynamic content tailored to the user's settings.
